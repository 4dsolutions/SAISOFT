    "Python often sits between you-the-user and some valuable data, such as your bank account or other treasure.  The goodies get stored in database vaults, in castle keeps, in safes.  Python-as-guardian or keeper of treasures, goes way back in serpent mythology.  Cryptography plays a role, in keeping the safes secure.\n",

    "When we say \"3rd party\" we mean Python resources that don't come in [the Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html).  We usually acquire these 3rd party resources by means of [pip](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_pip.asp) or, if using [the conda distribution of Python](http://www.anaconda.org), the conda installer.  Mac users may resort to [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on occassion."
