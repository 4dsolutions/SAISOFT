    "# Remembering Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking back on this course, you'll have had some quality time with but a few of the many riches stored out there in the cloud:  Sphinx, Django, Flask, pandas, PyCrypto, pillow, matplotlib and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also considered the many IDEs (with an emphasis on Spyder) and kept returning to Jupyter Notebooks (as we're doing here), and Jupyter Labs.  Anaconda was our default distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "However the main focus was on making the code readable, comprehensible, and that meant we focused on grammar and a core vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coming out the other end of the tunnel, it pays to review.\n",
    "\n",
    "What were some of the core ideas again?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our review here covers some of the basic concepts, but in the examples reaches into some of the more arcane corners of the language.  Python remains engaging and entertaining, is the message there.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mutable versus Immutable\n",
    "\n",
    "As you continue to explore the many languages, such as Clojure and Rust, you will come to appreciate the big difference immutability makes.  When you can count on an object to stay constant, the compiler has so much less to worry about.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Python's overall permissiveness and mutability, means it's a runtime experience first and foremost, with the compiling step not really a time for exhaustive checking, at least not for type consistency.  You might get some help from 3rd party tools, as Python does support type annotations."

    "\n",
    "Think of an iterable as a sequence of lilly pads across a pond, with the iterators being the frogs that hop along them, from one to the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way to check if an object is an iterator is to look for both ```__next__``` and ```__iter__```.  Those are the spots that tell you it's a leopard.  We often classify classes according to their signature methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "An iterable needs at least a ```__getitem__```, in which case Python's built-in iter( ) will assume consecutive integers starting from 0, fed to ```__getitem__```, is a sensible meaning for the iterator's ```__next__```."
