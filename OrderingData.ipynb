    "# Data Structures:  Keeping Data Organized\n",
    "#### by Kirby Urner\n",
    "\n",
    "The verb \"keep\" is interesting, in that if you've studied the anatomy of castles, you'll know the central building, where the crown, jewels and sceptre are kept, is called the Keep.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping Data, might be a term of art, although it currently isn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, in fairy tales, [a dragon](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonHoard) keeps guard over the hoard of treasure.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Probably the first data structure you encounter in Python will be the list, although technically the string is a data structure (of letters, or str type objects).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Then come the tuple (like an immutable list) and the dict (not even a sequence).  \n",
    "\n",
    "All of these types use square brackets (`[]`) to retrieve contents, and matching up with square brackets are Python special names ```__getitem__``` and ```__setitem__```.\n",
    "\n",
    "As Alex Martelli points out in one of his lectures, special names are deliberately \"ugly\" because we want to steer coders towards using square brackets when feasible.  Sometimes, though, we have to get behind the scenes, under the surface, into the guts of Python, and that's where special names (or ```__ribs___```) as I call them, come into focus."
